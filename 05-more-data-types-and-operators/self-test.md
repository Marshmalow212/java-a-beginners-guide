# Chapter 5 Self Test

1. `double[] dbls = new double[12]` vs. `double dbls[] = new double[12]`.
2. `int[] ints = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }`.
3. See [`Avgs.java`](Avgs.java).
4. See [`BubbleStr.java`](BubbleStr.java); had to use `compareTo`.
5. Left-to-right vs. right-to-left.
6. See [`Scratch5.java`](Scratch5.java). But again, there is a demonstrable difference between string literals and string objects. I think what is _really_ going on is some kind of autoboxing, similar to JS.
7. See [`Encode.java`](Encode.java).
8. No, because `double` is a floating-point encoding.
9. `y = x < 0 ? 10 : 20;`
10. Logical (boolean).
11. Yes, out-of-bounds error for both.
12. Zero-fill right shift.
13. See [`MinMax.java`](MinMax.java)
14. Not as I've written it, due to optimizations (unless we add `break`s).
15. Yes.
16. `var`
17. `var done = false`
18. Yes and no respectively.
19. `var[]` is an error ("var cannot be an element of array").
20. No, cannot string multiple `var` declarations.
21. See [`ShowBits.java`](ShowBits.java)
