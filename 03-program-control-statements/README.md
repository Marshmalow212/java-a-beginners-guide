# 3. Program Control Statements

- `System.in.read` appears to be a synchronous/blocking line-buffered input.
- `if` conditions must evaluate to a Boolean, according to the book – no "truthiness"
- `switch` cases just like JS except that the expression type is restricted.
- `for` loops seem identical to JS, except that the condition must be a Bool.
- null statements are empty semicolons, e.g. `for (int i = 0; i < 5; sum += i++) ;`
- enhanced `for` loop will be shown later in the book.
- `while` loop same as JS too…
