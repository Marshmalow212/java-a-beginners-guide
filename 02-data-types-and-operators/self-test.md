# Chapter 2 Self Test

1. Why spec primitives? This is a super-open-ended question, I mean I could go on about type theory, API contracts, etc. I suspect the author wants me to say something about portability in here.
1. The char type is a UTF-16 char expressed as an integral Unicode code point.
1. Bools can be any val? False.
1. `System.out.println("One\nTwo\Three")`
1. What is wrong with the snippet? A: reset block-scoped var
1. Prefix ops mutate before returning val to expr; postfix mutates after.
1. Short-circuiting guard for division: `d != 0 && n/d > v`
1. `byte` and `short` are promoted to `int`
1. Casts are needed for incompatible types and/or narrowing conversion
1. See `./Primes.java`
1. Redundant parens don't affect program performance.
1. Blocks do define a scope.
